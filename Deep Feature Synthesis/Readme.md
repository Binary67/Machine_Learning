# Deep Feature Synthesis

Deep Feature Synthesis was invented by MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab in 2014, Kalyan Veeramachaneni and Max Kanter. It is used to perform automated feature engineering. 

Feature Engineering is one of the most important element in machine learning. For most of the machine learning model, a good feature engineering will help to improve the accuracy and minimize loss. Deep learning might not require a well engineered features, but it requires a tremendous amount of data to train the neural network. Compared to other Machine Learning Algorithm, they only need adequate amount of data and feature engineering is used to accelerate the process of applying machine learning to the valuable datasets.

# Featuretools
Featuretools is a framework to perform automated feature engineering. It excels at transforming temporal and relational datasets into feature matrices for machine learning. In this repo, we are using the titanic dataset from Kaggle, and try to use Deep Feature Synthesis to create additional features for the dataset.
